The VBA of Wall Street - Bootcamp HW2

In this homework assignment, VBA is used to analyze stock market date for one year.

The VBA script loops through all of the data on various sheets and makes a summary table of the following:
  - ticker symbol in alphabetical order
  - yearly change from opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year
  - percent change from opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year
  - total stock volume 
  
The yearly change will be highlighted in green to indicate a positive change and red for a negative change.

For the bonus, the script will return the stock with the greatest percent increase, the greatest percent decrease and 
the greatest total volume.
